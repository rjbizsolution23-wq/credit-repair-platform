Your credit report includes identifying information — like your address and date of birth — and information about your credit history — like how you pay your bills or if you filed for bankruptcy. Three nationwide credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) collect and update this information. Not all creditors report information to credit bureaus, but most nationwide chain store and bank credit card accounts, along with loans, are included in credit reports.The information in your credit report can affect your buying power. It can also affect your chance to get a job, rent or buy a place to live, and buy insurance. Credit bureaus sell the information in your report to businesses that use it to decide whether to loan you money, give you credit, offer you insurance, or rent you a home. Some employers use credit reports in hiring decisions. The strength of your credit history also affects how much you will have to pay to borrow money.The credit bureaus mustmake sure that the information they collect about you is accurategive you a free copy of your report once every 12 monthsgive you a chance to fix any mistakesThe Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), a federal law, requires this.Why get a copy of my report?Getting your credit report can help protect your credit history from errors and help you spot signs of identity theft.Check to be sure the information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

Be prepared to give your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth. If you’ve moved in the last two years, you may have to give your previous address. They’ll ask you some questions that only you would know, like the amount of your monthly mortgage payment. You must answer these questions for each credit bureau, even if you’re asking for your credit reports from each credit bureau at the same time. Each credit bureau may ask you for different information because the information each has in your file may come from different sources.When will my report arrive?Depending on how you ordered it, you can get it right away or within 15 daysonline at AnnualCreditReport.com — you’ll get access immediatelyby calling toll-free 1-877-322-8228 — it’ll be processed and mailed to you within 15 daysby mail using the Annual Credit Report Request Form — it’ll be processed and mailed to you within 15 days of receipt of your requestIt may take longer to get your report if the credit bureau needs more information to verify your identity.Can I get my reports in Braille, large print, or audio formats?Yes, your free annual credit reports are available in Braille, large print, or audio formats.

Some financial advisors say staggering your requests during a 12-month period may be a good way to keep an eye on the accuracy and completeness of the information in your reports.

Other sites pretend to be associated with AnnualCreditReport.com or claim to offer free credit reports, free credit scores, or free credit monitoring. They also use terms like “free report” in their names. They might even have URLs that misspell — on purpose — AnnualCreditReport.com in the hope that you’ll mistype the name of the official site. If you visit one of these imposter sites, you might wind up on other sites that want to sell you something or collect — and then sell or misuse — your personal information. AnnualCreditReport.com and the credit bureaus will not email you asking for your Social Security number or account information. If you get an email, see a pop-up ad, or get a phone call from someone claiming to be from AnnualCreditReport.com or any of the credit bureaus, don’t reply or click on any link in the message.

They might buy things with your credit cards, get new credit cards in your name, open a phone, electricity, or gas account in your name, steal your tax refund, or use your health insurance to get medical care. Then, when they don’t pay the bills, the account is reported on your credit report as unpaid and delinquent. Inaccurate information like that could end up on your credit report and affect your ability to get credit, insurance, or even a job. If you think someone might be using your personal information, go to IdentityTheft.gov to report it and get a personalized recovery plan. What If The Information is Right…But Not Good? If there’s information in your credit history that’s correct, but negative — for example, if you’ve made late payments — the credit bureaus can put it in your credit report. But it doesn’t stay there forever. As long as the information is correct, a credit bureau can report most negative information for seven years, and bankruptcy information for 10 years. How To Correct Mistakes in Your Credit Report Both the credit bureau and the business that supplied the information to a credit bureau have to correct information that’s wrong or incomplete in your report. And they have to do it for free. To correct mistakes in your report, contact the credit bureau and the business that reported the inaccurate information. Tell them you want to dispute that information on your report. Here’s how. Dispute mistakes with the credit bureaus You should dispute with each credit bureau that has the mistake. Explain in writing what you think is wrong, include the credit bureau’s dispute form (if they have one), copies of documents that support your dispute, and keep records of everything you send. If you send your dispute by mail, you can use the address found on your credit report or a credit bureau’s address for disputes. Equifax More information about Equifax’s dispute process. Mail your letter to: Equifax Information Services LLC P.O. Box 740256 Atlanta, GA 30348 Experian More information about Experian’s dispute process and dispute form. Mail the form with your letter to: Experian P.O. Box 4500 Allen, TX 75013 Transunion More information about Transunion’s dispute process by mail and dispute form. Mail the form with your letter to: TransUnion LLC Consumer Dispute Center P.O. Box 2000 Chester, PA 19016 Use this sample letter to help write your own. Your letter should: Ask the credit bureau to remove or correct the inaccurate or incomplete information. Include: your complete name and address each mistake that you want fixed, and why copies (not originals) of documents that support your request a copy of your report (circle the mistakes you want fixed), Send your letter by certified mail and pay for a “return receipt” so you have a record the credit bureau got it. Keep copies of everything you sent. The credit bureaus also accept disputes online or by phone: Experian (888) 397-3742 Transunion (800) 916-8800 Equifax (866) 349-5191 What happens after you dispute with a credit bureau However you filed your dispute, the credit bureau has 30 days to investigate it. If the credit bureau considers your request to be “frivolous” or “irrelevant,” they will stop investigating, but they need to notify you of that and give the reason. For instance, you may need to give them additional evidence to support your request. The credit bureau will also forward all the evidence you submitted to the business that reported the information. Then, the business must investigate and report the results back to the credit bureau. If the business finds the information they reported is inaccurate, it must notify all three nationwide credit bureaus so they can correct the information in your file. The credit bureau must give you the results in writing and, if the dispute results in a change, a free copy of your credit report. This doesn’t count as your free annual credit report. The credit bureau must send notices of the correction(s) to anyone who got your report in the past six months, if you ask must send notice of the correction to anyone who got a copy for employment purposes during the past two years, if you ask What if the investigation doesn’t resolve your dispute You can ask that a statement of the dispute be included in your file and in future reports. Also, you can ask that the credit bureau give your statement to anyone who got a copy of your report in the recent past — you can expect the credit bureau to charge you a fee to do this. Dispute it with the business that supplied the information Use this sample letter to dispute mistakes with businesses that reported the inaccurate or incomplete information. The letter should say you’re disputing errors and should include: your complete name and address; each bit of inaccurate information that you want fixed, and why; and copies (not originals) of documents that support your request. Many businesses want disputes sent to a particular address. If you can’t find a dispute address on your credit report or online, contact the business and ask for the correct address to send your letter. What happens after you dispute with a business that supplied the information If the business keeps reporting the disputed information to a credit bureau, it must let the credit bureau know about your dispute and the credit bureau must include a notice that you are disputing it as inaccurate or incomplete. If the business finds the information you dispute to be inaccurate or incomplete, the business must tell the credit bureau to update or delete that information from your report. Monitor Your Credit Reports Review your credit report to confirm that the credit bureau removed the inaccurate information from your report. If the business keeps reporting disputed information, check that the credit bureaus placed a notice that you are disputing that information. Report Scams If you see a scam, fraud, or bad business practices, tell the FTC. Go to ReportFraud.ftc.gov, the FTC’s website that makes it easy for you to report.

Debt Consolidation Debt Settlement: Cheapest Way to Get Out of Debt? Definition A credit score is a numerical expression representing the creditworthiness of an individual that helps determine the amount they can borrow and the applicable interest rate. What Is a Credit Score? A credit score is a three-digit number that rates an individual's creditworthiness and ability to obtain a loan, mortgage, or credit card. A credit score is based on a person's credit history, which includes their active accounts, total debt levels, and repayment history. The Fair Isaac Corp., now known as FICO, created the credit score model. The FICO Score is the most commonly used, ranging from 300 to 850. Key Takeaways Lenders use credit scores to evaluate an individual's ability to repay loans.The three main U.S. credit bureaus are Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.Federal law enables consumers to obtain a free annual copy of their credit report from each of the three credit bureaus. Fast Fact Your credit score may determine the size of the deposit required to get a smartphone, cable service, or utilities, or to rent an apartment. Prospective employers may also check a candidate's credit score before making an offer. How Credit Scores Work A credit score can significantly affect your financial life. It plays a key role in a lender’s decision to offer you credit. Lenders are more likely to approve you for loans when you have a higher credit score and are more likely to decline your loan applications when you have lower scores. You can also get better interest rates when you have a higher credit score, which can save you money in the long term. Conversely, a credit score of 700 or higher is generally viewed positively by lenders and may result in a lower interest rate. Scores greater than 800 are considered excellent. Every creditor defines its own ranges for credit scores and its own criteria for lending. Here are the general ranges for how credit scores are categorized. Excellent: 800–850Very Good: 740–799Good: 670–739Fair: 580–669Poor: 300–579 Tip Order your copy of Investopedia's What To Do With $10,000 magazine for more tips about managing debt and building credit. How Your Credit Score Is Calculated The three major credit reporting agencies in the U.S. (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion) report, update, and store consumers’ credit histories. While there can be differences in the information collected by the three credit bureaus, five main factors are evaluated when calculating a credit score: Payment history (35%)Amounts owed (30%)Length of credit history (15%)Types of credit (10%)New credit (10%) Payment history: Your payment history includes whether you've paid your bills on time. It takes into account how many late payments you've had and how late they were. Amounts owed: Amounts owed is the percentage of credit you've used compared to the credit available to you, which is known as credit utilization. Length of credit history: Longer credit histories are considered less risky, as there is more data to determine payment history. Credit mix: A variety of credit types shows lenders you can manage various types of credit. It can include installment credit, such as car loans or mortgage loans, and revolving credit, such as credit cards. New credit: Lenders view new credit as a potential sign you may be desperate for credit. Too many recent applications for credit can negatively affect your credit score. Ellen Lindner / Investopedia Kathryn Hauer, CFP, Enrolled AgentWilson David Investment Advisors, Aiken, SCIf you have many credit cards and want to close some that you do not use, closing credit cards can indeed lower your score.Instead of closing accounts, gather up the cards you don’t use. Keep them in a safe place in separate, labeled envelopes. Go online to access and check each of your cards. For each, ensure that there is no balance and that your address, email address, and other contact info are correct. Also, make sure that you don’t have autopay set up on any of them. In the section where you can have alerts, make sure you have your email address or phone in there. Make it a point to regularly check that no fraudulent activity occurs on them, since you aren’t going to be using them. Set yourself a reminder to check them all every six months or every year to make sure there have been no charges on them and that nothing unusual has happened. VantageScore VantageScore is a consumer credit rating product developed by the Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion credit bureaus as an alternative to the FICO Score. FICO creates a single bureau-specific score for each of the three credit bureaus, using only information from that bureau. As a result, the FICO is actually three scores, not one, and they can vary slightly as each bureau will have different calculation methods. A VantageScore is a single, tri-bureau score combining information from all three credit bureaus and used by each of them in the same way. Fast Fact FICO score is the most popular credit score, used by about 90% of lenders. How to Improve Your Credit Score When information is updated on a borrower’s credit report, their credit score changes and can rise or fall based on new information. Here are some ways that you can improve your credit score: Pay your bills on time: Six months of on-time payments are required to see a noticeable difference in your score. Increase your credit line: If you have credit card accounts, call and inquire about a credit increase. If your account is in good standing, you should be granted an increase in your credit limit. However, it is important not to spend this amount to maintain a lower credit utilization rate. Meanwhile, try to pay down your debt. Don’t close a credit card account: If you are not using a certain credit card, it is best to stop using it instead of closing the account. Depending on a card's age and credit limit, it can hurt your credit score if you close the account. Work with a credit repair company: If you don’t have the time to improve your credit score, credit repair companies can negotiate with your creditors and the three credit agencies on your behalf, in exchange for a monthly fee. Correct any errors on your credit report: You are entitled to one free credit report per year from each of the main credit bureaus. You can get your report through AnnualCreditReport.com. You can also hire a monitoring service to help keep your information secure. What Is a Good Credit Score to Have? What constitutes a good credit score is ultimately determined by the lenders. Ranges vary depending on the credit scoring model. Generally, credit scores from 580 to 669 are considered fair; 670 to 739 are considered good; 740 to 799 are considered very good; and 800 and higher are considered excellent. Who Calculates Credit Scores? There are three major credit bureaus in the United States: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. They each calculate your FICO score in different ways using the same information. Credit bureaus collect, analyze, and disburse information about consumers in the credit markets. How Can I Raise My Credit Score Quickly? To raise your credit score quickly, you can enroll in a service that includes other payment information, such as your rent and utilities payments, not typically included in your credit score. If you have a good track record with these kinds of bills, enrolling in a service like Experian Boost could raise your credit score quickly. The Bottom Line Your credit score is a number that can have a significant impact on your financial life. If you have a good credit score, you are more likely to qualify for loans and to get better terms that can save you money. Learning what your credit score is and what goes into calculating it can help you improve it. Article Sources Investopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.

      "content": "Building credit can be tricky. If you don’t have credit history, or you have a thin credit file, it can be hard to get a loan, a credit card or even rent an apartment. But how are you supposed to show a history of responsible repayment if no one will give you credit in the first place?Here's a look at credit-building tools, and how to use them to earn a good credit score. How to build credit with a credit cardA credit card can be a great tool to help you build credit. When used responsibly, you can make purchases, pay the balance in full and avoid interest, all while building a history of on-time payments that looks great to potential lenders. However, there are downsides to opening a credit card. There is a risk of accumulating debt that’s challenging to pay off each month, leading to interest payments. Missing a payment will also harm your score. For example, a late payment by more than 30 days will stay on your credit report for seven years. Track your credit score in 2025 with the NerdWallet appWhen your score changes, our app tells you why — and suggests what to do in the future.Try a secured credit cardIf you want to avoid the potential pitfalls of a traditional credit card, consider a secured card. A secured card is backed by a cash deposit you make upfront, and the minimum and maximum amount you can deposit varies by card — although many cards require a minimum deposit of $200. The deposit amount is usually the same as your credit limit. A secured credit card works like any other credit card: Buy things, make a payment on or before the due date and incur interest if you don’t pay your balance in full. You’ll receive your deposit back when you close the account.Secured credit cards aren’t meant to be used forever. The purpose of a secured card is to build your credit enough to qualify for an unsecured card — a card without a deposit and with better benefits. Choose a secured card with a low annual fee and make sure it reports payment data to all three credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Your credit score is built using information collected in your credit reports, so cards that report to all three bureaus allow you to build a more comprehensive credit history.» Ready to get started? Shop the best secured credit cards How to build credit without a credit card You don’t necessarily need a credit card to build credit. There are several tools that can help you establish a credit history. Get a credit-builder loan The purpose of a credit-builder loan is to help people build credit, but it also helps build savings at the same time. Typically, the money you borrow is held by the lender in an account and not released to you until the loan is repaid. Your payments are reported to credit bureaus, which establish a history of paying on time. These loans are most often offered by credit unions or community banks. You can also get them through online lenders. Use a co-signerIt’s also possible to get a loan or an unsecured credit card using a co-signer. But be sure that you and the co-signer understand that the co-signer is on the hook for the full amount owed if you don't pay.Become an authorized user An authorized user is someone who is added to a primary cardholder’s credit card without being responsible for the balance. With their name now attached to the credit card account, the authorized user benefits from the cardholder’s good credit, on-time payment history and low credit utilization. Both parties should come to an agreement on whether and how authorized users can use the card before they’re added. Authorized users don't have to use — or even possess — the credit card at all to benefit from the arrangement.Authorized users will typically see the primary cardholder’s credit card account added to their credit reports after a few months. Not all credit card companies report authorized user accounts to the credit bureaus. It’s up to the primary cardholder to find out whether their card does, so that the credit-building efforts won’t go to waste.Authorized user status can be especially useful for a younger person who is just starting to build credit. Being an authorized user can help reduce the amount of time it takes to generate a FICO score. There are other benefits, too, such as establishing a history of on-time payments, reducing your credit utilization ratio or extending the length of your credit history. » LEARN: What affects your credit score? Get credit for the bills you payRent-reporting services take a bill you are already paying and put it on your credit report. This helpw to build a positive history of on-time payments. Not every credit score takes these payments into account, but some do, and that may be enough to get a loan or credit card that firmly establishes your credit history for all lenders.Some rent reporting services are provided by landlords or property managers and renters can opt in, while other services come at a cost to the renter. You can get credit for other kinds of bills, too. For example, Experian Boost offers a way to have your cell phone and utility bills reflected in your credit report with that credit bureau. Note that the effect is limited only to your credit report with Experian — and any credit scores calculated using Experian credit report data. Practice good credit habits Try to make your payments on time, and pay at least the minimum if you can. Paying credit card or loan payments on time, every time, is the most important thing you can do to help build your score. If you are able to pay more than the minimum, that is also helpful for your score.If you use credit cards, keep your credit utilization low. Credit utilization is the percentage of your credit limit you use. We recommend keeping your credit utilization below 30% on all cards when possible. The lower your utilization, the better it is for your score.Avoid applying for multiple credit accounts close together.Credit applications can cause a small, temporary drop in your score. However, multiple applications during a short period of time can cause significant damage. NerdWallet recommends spacing applications by about six months if you can. Keep credit card accounts open. Unless you have a compelling reason to close an account, like a high annual fee or poor customer service, consider keeping it open. Closing an account can affect your credit utilization. You can also explore downgrading it or transferring your credit limit to another card. Check your credit scores and reports There are two barometers you should regularly check to keep your credit building journey on track: Credit reports A credit report is a record of how you've used credit in the past. You have three credit reports, one from each major credit bureau. Your credit report contains your personal information — your name, addresses, phone numbers — a list of all your accounts and their balances, credit inquiries made by lenders and negative information, including missed payments, bankruptcies. Request your credit reports and check each for errors and discrepancies. You can check your reports for free weekly by using AnnualCreditReport.com.

      "content": "Credit Score Basics: Everything You Need to KnowBy Louis DeNicola11 min readOct 22, 2024Quick AnswerHaving good credit scores can help you qualify for the best financial products and offers. Itâs important to understand the difference between FICO and VantageScoreÂ®, how credit scores are calculated and how to improve your credit. Your credit scores can affect many aspects of your life, and learning more about how credit scores actually work can take some of the mystery and confusion out of managing your credit. In this guide, we'll cover all the basics you need to know: what a credit score is, why there are multiple credit scores, what affects your credit scores and how to improve your credit. What Is a Credit Score? A credit score is a simple-to-read number that can help creditors understand credit riskâthe risk that they won't get repaid in full. It also helps consumers get a better understanding of their overall credit health. Credit scores are calculated by credit scoring models. These scoring models are trained to analyze a consumer's credit report from one of the three consumer credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion or Equifax. Specifically, many models are designed to predict the likelihood that someone will miss a payment by at least 90 days during the next 24 months. Many credit scores range from 300 to 850, and a higher score is better because it indicates a person is less likely to fall behind on bill payments. However, a score doesn't consistently correlate with a specific likelihood of missing a payment. Instead, credit scores are a ranking system that tries to list consumers from most to least risky. For example, someone might have a FICOÂ® ScoresÎ 8 of 700. The score doesn't necessarily mean the person is a specific percentage less likely to miss a payment than someone else. However, in aggregate, people with a 700 FICOÂ® Score 8 are less likely to miss a payment than those with a score of 600 and more likely to miss a payment than those with a score of 800. Learn more: What Are the Different Credit Score Ranges? Why Lenders Use Credit Scores Lenders use credit scores to help assess risk and automate credit decisions. For example, credit card companies may use your credit scores for: Preapproved credit offers: A credit card issuer that's marketing a credit card might send preapproved credit offers to people who have at least a minimum credit score and meet other requirements. Credit application reviews: Card issuers will also often check credit scores when people apply for a new credit card. The issuer might use scores to approve or deny applications, set interest rates and determine the credit limit on approved accounts. Ongoing credit monitoring: Once you get a credit card, the issuer might monitor your credit reports and scores. Changes in your credit score could prompt the lender to offer you additional credit accounts, send you promotional offers or change your credit limit. Auto lenders, mortgage lenders and other financial institutions use credit scores in similar ways.

Although most of their credit scores rely on the same underlying data to make predictions, the two companies take a slightly different approach to credit scoring. Here's an overview of some of the similarities and differences. FICOÂ® ScoreVantageScore Credit ScoreTypical score rangeBase scores: 300 to 850Industry-specific scores: 250 to 900300 to 850Recent scoring modelsFICOÂ® Score 8, 9, 10 and 10 TVantageScore 3, 4 and 4plusâ¢Minimum scoring requirements A credit account that's at least six months old, and Activity on a credit account during the previous six months, and No indication that the person is deceased A credit account, or Public records and a collection account, and No indication that the person is deceased Hard inquiry treatment Considers hard inquiries from the previous 12 months Ignores hard inquiries from the previous 30 days Counts multiple student, auto and mortgage loan inquiries from a 45-day period as one inquiry Considers hard inquiries from the previous 12 months Counts multiple hard inquiries from a 14-day period as one Learn more: The Difference Between VantageScore Credit Scores and FICOÂ® Scores Why Are There So Many Different Credit Scores? There are several reasons that there are so many credit scores. One is that FICO and VantageScore regularly develop and release new credit scoresâFICO alone has dozens of credit scoring models. Additionally, other companies develop and sell credit scores to creditors, and some creditors develop their own scores as well. As a result, you might find that when you check your credit scores, you get different results. And now you know that's not necessarily a mistake or error. The score you receive can depend on the scoring model, which of your credit reports it analyzed and when the score was generated. Any changes in one of those factors could lead to a different score. Learn more: Why Are My Credit Scores Different? Types of Credit Scores Here are examples of five common types of credit scores lenders might use: Base FICOÂ® Scores: Base FICO credit scores include the FICOÂ® Score 8, 9, 10 and 10 T; FICO designs these scores for any type of lender to use. Unlike the others, FICOÂ® Score 10 T considers trends in your credit history, such as changes in your balances or credit utilization ratio over time. Industry-specific FICOÂ® Scores: FICO also creates industry-specific scores for auto lenders and credit card issuers. These build a base score to better predict the likelihood of someone missing an auto loan or credit card payment. VantageScore credit scores: VantageScore offers five credit scores: VantageScore 1 through 4 and VantageScore 4plus. The VantageScore 4plus stands apart from the others because it gives consumers the option of connecting their bank or credit card accounts and using the data from these accounts to potentially adjust their score. Credit scores that use alternative data: Many credit scores only consider the information in one of your credit reports. But some scores can consider alternative credit data, such as your utility bill payment history, public records, banking history or history with payday loans. VantageScore 4plus and FICO's UltraFICO and FICO XD scores are three examples. Proprietary credit risk scores: Some financial institutions create their own credit scores. These scores might consider internal data that the company has about you alongside information from your credit report and one of your FICO or VantageScore credit scores. The additional insight could make the scores more predictive than using a generic credit score from FICO or VantageScore on its own. Companies often use these types of credit scores to make lending decisions and manage accounts after someone receives a loan or credit card. Additionally, insurance companies in many states can use credit-based insurance scores to help determine who to offer insurance and how much to charge. Learn more: Facts About Credit You May Not Know How Are Credit Scores Calculated? Credit scoring models generally calculate your score by reviewing the information in one of your credit reports from Experian, TransUnion or Equifax. Various models may consider slightly different information or use different weighting when scoring your credit report. However, the factors that can affect your credit scores are generally grouped into several categories. Even if the precise details differ from one score to another, focusing on the big picture could help you improve all your credit scores. Your Payment History Your payment history is the most important factor in your credit scores, making up 35% of your FICOÂ® Score. This category includes whether you've made payments on time, which can help your credit, or missed payments, which can hurt it. How far behind you've fallen on past-due accounts can also affect your scores. Bankruptcy filings and collection accounts are additional negative items related to your payment history that could hurt your credit scores. How Much You Owe The amounts you owe on various credit accounts is also an important factor in your credit score calculation. This factor makes up 30% of your FICOÂ® Score. Scoring models might consider how many accounts you have with balances, how much you owe overall and the current balance relative to the starting balance on a loan. Your revolving credit utilization can also be a major influence in this category. It depends on the reported balances and credit limits on revolving accounts, such as credit cards. A lower utilization rate is best for your scores. Learn more: How to Calculate Credit Card Utilization Your History With Credit Accounts Having a lengthy history with credit could help your credit scores. The scoring models might consider the age of the oldest and newest accounts in your credit report, along with the average age of all your credit accounts. These age-related factors may consider the ages of opened and closed accounts, which can stay on your credit report for up to 10 years if they're in good standing when the account is closed or paid off. Length of credit history counts for 15% of your FICOÂ® Score. Your Experience With Different Types of Credit Having open installment and revolving credit accounts, such as loans and credit cards, might help your credit scores. Credit mix accounts for 10% of your FICOÂ® Score. Your experience with particular types of accounts, such as an auto loan, could also be important for industry-specific FICOÂ® Scores. Recent Credit Activity New credit applications can result in hard inquiries, a record of when a creditor checks your credit before making a lending decision. New hard inquiries could hurt your credit scores a little, typically just a few points. Having multiple new accounts and how long it's been since you opened different types of accounts could also affect your scores. New credit makes up about 10% of your FICOÂ® Score. Some Things Don't Affect Your Credit Scores Most credit scores don't consider certain pieces of personal or financial information, including: Income, employer and employment status Age, gender, race, ethnicity or disabilities Nationality, citizenship status or marital status Religious or political affiliations Some of this information doesn't affect your credit scores because it isn't in your credit report, such as your income. However, creditors might ask about your income on a credit application, and it could affect your eligibility and offers. What Is a Good Credit Score? FICO and VantageScore share general guidelines for what they consider to be a good scoreâ670 and up for FICO, and 661 or higher for VantageScore credit scores. However, creditors can set their own standards for what they consider to be poor, good and excellent credit scores. Here's how FICO and VantageScore credit score ranges compare. FICOÂ® ScoreVantageScore Credit ScoreExceptional800 to 850Excellent781 to 850Very good740 to 799Good661 to 780Good670 to 739Fair601 to 660Fair580 to 669Poor500 to 600Poor300 to 579Very poor300 to 499 Having a good credit score can be important because it can help you qualify for more financial products and receive better offers. A higher score can help you get: Higher loan and credit limits Lower interest rates Lower or fewer fees Landlords may also check and consider your credit when you apply for housing, and cellphone companies might consider your credit if you want to finance a phone or get a postpaid phone plan. Utility companies may even consider your credit when deciding if and how much to require for a security deposit when you want to open a new account. Tip: Prospective employers may check your credit during the application process to verify your identity and gauge your reliability and financial management skills. However, employers cannot see your credit score. Learn more: Reasons You Want a Good Credit Score How to Improve Your Credit Score The specific steps you'll want to take to improve your credit scores could depend on the scoring model and what's affecting your credit scores today. However, there are some general tips that could help improve many of your scores over time. Pay Bills on Time On-time loan and credit card payments can help you build a long and positive credit history. Paying other bills on time can also be important. Even if your on-time payments don't get reported to the credit bureaus and help your credit scores, a company might send past-due accounts to collections, which could hurt your credit. Pay Down Credit Card Debt If you're carrying credit card balances from month to month, try to pay off your balances and start paying your bills in full. Doing so can help you save money on interest and lower your credit utilization rate. Make Credit Card Payments Early You might have a high utilization rate even if you pay your credit card balance in full every month. Credit card issuers usually report your balance to the bureaus when your billing cycle ends, which could be several weeks before your bill's due date. If you're using your credit cards to earn rewards and get purchase protections, you might want to pay down your balance early to lower your utilization rate. You could also request a credit line increase or apply for another credit card to increase your available credit and lower your utilization rate. Learn more: Ways to Keep Your Credit Utilization Low Bring Past-Due Accounts Current Catching up on an account that's past due might help your credit scores even if it won't remove the late payments from your credit history. Late payments, along with most negative marks, can stay on your credit reports for seven years from when they first occur. If you have accounts in collections, settling or paying off the debt could also help your credit scoresâthough the negative marks for the overdue balances will remain for seven years. Strategically Apply for Credit New credit applications typically lead to hard inquiries that may hurt your credit scores slightly. Hard inquiries are often a minor scoring factor, and you don't necessarily need to hold off on applications when there's a great offer or you need a loan. But try to be strategic when you apply. You could start by looking for card issuers and lenders that will prequalify or preapprove you with a soft credit check, which can tell you if you'll likely get approved without affecting your credit scores. If you're shopping for an auto loan or mortgage, you could also group your applications with different lenders to limit the impact of the hard inquiries. Learn more: Do Multiple Loan Inquiries Affect Your Credit Score? Add Eligible Bills to Your Credit Report You could use the free Experian BoostÂ®Ã¸ feature to add eligible rent, utility, phone, insurance and certain streaming services payments to your Experian credit report. The additional accounts and payments could improve credit scores calculated by many of the latest FICO and VantageScore scoring models. Review Your Credit Reports for Errors Regularly review your credit reports and look for errors that might be hurting your credit scores. For example, if you notice a late payment in an account's history when you made the payment on time, you may want to have it corrected. You have the right to file disputes with the creditors or credit bureaus, and they'll investigate the reported information and either verify that it's accurate, correct it or remove it from your credit reports. Will Checking Your Credit Reports Affect Your Credit Scores? No, checking your credit reports or scores won't affect your credit scores. A record of when you check your own credit report or score will be added to the report each time, but it will be a soft credit check. Unlike hard inquiries, soft inquiries never affect your credit scores. Learn more: How Do You Check Your Credit Score?
