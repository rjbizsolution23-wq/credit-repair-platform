## Understanding Your Credit Score

Your credit score is a three-digit number that represents your creditworthiness to lenders. At Rick Jefferson Credit Solutions, we help you understand and improve this crucial financial metric.

### Credit Score Ranges:

- **Very Good (740-799)**: Good rates and favorable terms
- **Good (670-739)**: Fair rates with some limitations
- **Fair (580-669)**: Higher rates and stricter terms
- **Poor (300-579)**: Difficulty obtaining credit
