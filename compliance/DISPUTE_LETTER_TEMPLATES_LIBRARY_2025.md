Dear Credit Reporting Department,

I am disputing the following account that does not belong to me:

**Account Details:**
Creditor: [Creditor Name]
Account Number: [Account Number]
Date Opened: [Date]
Balance: [Amount]

**Dispute Reason:**
This account was never opened by me. I have no knowledge of this account and did not authorize its creation. This appears to be either:

- Reporting error

**Request for Action:**
Under FCRA §1681i, please investigate this account immediately. Since I cannot verify this as my account, it should be removed from my credit file.

Duplicate reporting violates Metro 2® standards for:
