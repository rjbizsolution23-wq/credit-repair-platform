OBJECTION HANDLING:

Price Objection:
"I understand the investment is significant. Let me ask you this: 
what's it costing you right now to have poor credit? Higher interest 
rates, security deposits, loan denials... Our clients typically save 
thousands in the first year alone."

DIY Objection:
"You absolutely can dispute items yourself. However, most people 
lack the time, knowledge, and persistence required. We've spent years 
mastering the FCRA and have relationships with all the bureaus. 
Would you perform surgery on yourself to save money?"

Timing Objection:
"I understand timing is important. But here's the reality: every month 
you wait is another month of paying higher interest rates and missing 
opportunities. The best time to start was yesterday. The second best 
time is today."
```
