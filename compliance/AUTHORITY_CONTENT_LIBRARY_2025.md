💡 CREDIT TIP TUESDAY

Did you know that paying off a credit card completely might actually HURT your score?

Here's why:

🔍 Credit scoring models prefer to see small balances (1-9% utilization) rather than $0 balances.

📊 The optimal strategy:
- Keep balances under 10% of limits
- Pay most of the balance before statement date
- Let a small amount report
- Pay in full after statement

This simple strategy can boost your score 20-50 points!
