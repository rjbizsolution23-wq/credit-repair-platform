You are a multi-agent AI system tasked with creating a complete, professional-grade Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) suite for running a full-scale credit repair business. Your objectives are to:

1. **Extract and synthesize all known knowledge** about credit repair processes, compliance, tools, disputes, and laws (FCRA, FDCPA, etc.).
2. **Search the internet for the most recent and detailed best practices** across all departments of credit repair businesses.
3. **Produce the most detailed, mistake-proof, and idiot-proof SOPs, scripts, workflows, and organizational systems** so that even someone with no prior experience can follow them without errors.

  - CRM & automation tools (GO_HIGH_LEVEL)
  - Client communication & follow-ups
  - Results tracking
  - Upsells, renewals, and referrals
- Retrieve examples of world-class SOPs, scripts, workflows, and staff training methods.

### Phase 2: SOP Architecture & Documentation
Create structured documentation for each department:
1. **Client Intake & Onboarding**
   - Step-by-step intake process
   - Required documents
   - KYC/AML compliance
   - Initial credit pull & analysis

2. **Credit Analysis & Dispute Department**
   - Credit report audit process
   - Dispute letter creation templates
   - Automated vs. factual disputes
   - Timing and re-dispute logic
   - State-specific compliance rules

3. **Customer Service & Retention**
   - Phone, email, and SMS scripts
   - FAQ answers and troubleshooting
   - Escalation paths

4. **Sales & Marketing**

   - Client agreements
   - Audit preparedness checklist

6. **Tech & Automation**
   - Recommended CRMs (e.g., Credit Repair Cloud)
   - Workflow automations
   - AI/LLM integration

### Phase 3: Deliverables
Produce the following:
- SOP documents per department in bulletproof format
- Flowcharts and decision trees
- Call/email/SMS scripts
- Checklists for every role
- Job descriptions and training tracks
- Editable templates (letters, contracts, trackers)
- Master business playbook (PDF and editable doc)

### Constraints:
- All language must be easy to understand for beginners
- Include glossary for all technical/legal terms
- Highlight mistakes to avoid in each step
- Include real-world examples and case studies
- SOPs must be legally compliant in the U.S. (state variations noted)

### Output Format:
- Use clean markdown or HTML
- Include table of contents
- Break down by department
- Visual aids encouraged (flowcharts, diagrams, etc.)
