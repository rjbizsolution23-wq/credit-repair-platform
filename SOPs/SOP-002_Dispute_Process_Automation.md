Dear Credit Reporting Agency,

Pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) Section 609, I am requesting a complete and accurate disclosure of my credit file.

I am specifically disputing the following items as inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable:

[AUTOMATED_ITEM_LIST]

Please investigate these items and provide:
1. Complete payment history for each account
2. Original creditor information and contact details
3. Date of first delinquency (if applicable)
4. Method of verification used
5. Complete and accurate reporting

If you cannot verify the complete accuracy of these items, please delete them immediately as required by FCRA Section 611(a)(5)(A).

I have enclosed copies of my identification as required.

Sincerely,
[Client Signature]

Enclosures: Copy of Driver's License, Utility Bill
```

**Automation Workflow:**

Dear Data Furnisher,

Pursuant to FCRA Section 623(b), I am disputing the accuracy of information you are reporting about the above-referenced account.

Specific Inaccuracies:
[AUTOMATED_ERROR_LIST]
- Date of First Delinquency: Reported as [Date], should be [Correct Date]

I am requesting that you:
1. Conduct a reasonable investigation
2. Correct all inaccurate information

Failure to comply with FCRA Section 623 may result in regulatory complaints and legal action.

Dear [Bureau Name],

Specifically, please provide:
1. Name and title of person who verified the information
2. Date verification was completed
3. Documents reviewed during verification

```

### 3.4 Step 8-10: Regulatory and Legal Escalation

        "narrative": generate_narrative(dispute_history),
