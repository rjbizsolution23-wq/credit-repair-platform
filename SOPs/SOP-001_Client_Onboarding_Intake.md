## 2. Initial Consultation Process

### 2.1 Consultation Scheduling

**GoHighLevel Automation:**
1. Lead fills qualification form
2. System auto-books available slot
3. Confirmation SMS/email sent
4. Reminder sequence activated
5. Zoom link generated

**Consultation Preparation Checklist:**
- [ ] Review lead source and notes
- [ ] Prepare CROA disclosures
- [ ] Load consultation script
- [ ] Test technology setup
- [ ] Gather required documents

### 2.2 Consultation Script Framework

**Opening (2 minutes):**
```
"Hi [Name], I'm [Agent] with Rick Jefferson Solutions. Thank you for scheduling this consultation.

Before we begin, I want to be completely transparent: We cannot guarantee any specific results, and we cannot remove accurate information from your credit report. What we CAN do is help you understand your rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and assist with disputing inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable information.

Does that sound fair?"
```

**Discovery Questions (10 minutes):**
1. "What specific credit challenges are you facing?"
2. "When did you last review your credit reports?"
3. "What's your primary financial goal in the next 12 months?"
4. "Have you worked with a credit repair company before?"
5. "What's your budget for professional credit assistance?"

**Education Phase (8 minutes):**
- Explain FCRA rights (Sections 609, 611, 623)
- Overview of 10 Step Total Enforcement Chain™
- Realistic timeline expectations (3-6 months typical)
- Success stories (with disclaimers)

**Objection Handling:**

*"I can do this myself"*
> "You absolutely can! Many people successfully dispute items on their own. Our value is in the systematic approach, legal expertise, and time savings. We've helped 10,697 people navigate this process efficiently."

*"How can you guarantee results?"*
> "We can't and won't guarantee specific outcomes - that would be illegal under CROA. What we guarantee is our proven process, expert guidance, and full compliance with federal regulations."

*"This seems expensive"*
> "I understand budget concerns. Consider this: if we help you qualify for better interest rates, the savings on a single loan could pay for our services many times over. Plus, we offer payment plans to make this accessible."

### 2.3 CROA Compliance Requirements

**Required Disclosures (Must Read Verbatim):**

```
"Before we proceed, federal law requires me to inform you of your rights:

1. You have the right to dispute inaccurate information yourself, free of charge
2. You cannot be charged until services are fully performed
3. You have a 3-day right to cancel this contract
4. Credit repair companies cannot guarantee specific results
5. The credit repair process typically takes 3-6 months

Do you understand these rights, and do you have any questions?"
```
